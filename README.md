# knn_datacamp
I'm replicating DataCamp's introduction to k-nn models so I can understand what they are, how they work, etc. It was also good because it let me see that sometimes I am slow to understand what's going on if the code has broad names such as 'original target' and 'aggregated target', even if they explain what are those.
